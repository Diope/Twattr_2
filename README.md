## **Second pass at Michael Hartl’s Rails Tutorial.**

I found my initial attempt at Hartl’s tutorial to be overbearing mostly because prior to jumping into it, all I had were preconceived notions and about a week’s worth of One Month Rails that I crammed into 10hr a day sessions.

After going through Hartl’s tutorial the first time, I started reading about rails and learning about Ruby (which the later is still an ongoing thing for me, I find the language and programming in general to be very enjoyable).

I’m going through the Hartl tutorial again, this time I feel I’ll be able to absorb more of the TDD/BDD points as I have a much firmer base understanding of how Rails works.

My name is Dion…and this is my journey.
